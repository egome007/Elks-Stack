          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Background:</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">Starbucks was founded in 1971. Later, Howard Shultz took over. His vision and mission was to “Make America’s third place &amp; Establish as the most recognized coffee brand." During its early days, the company specialized in selling whole coffee beans and premium coffee beverages. Its target customers were the affluent, well-educated segment of the market. It subsequently achieved immense success and it spent almost nothing on advertising. The company’s experiential branding strategy has three components:</p>
          <ul style="font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 30px 40px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(22, 32, 64); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 19.2px; background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">
            <li style="margin-left: 15px; box-sizing: border-box; list-style-type: disc;">Coffee</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 15px; box-sizing: border-box; list-style-type: disc;">Service</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 15px; box-sizing: border-box; list-style-type: disc;">Ambiance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This branding strategy is based on the human spirit, a sense of community, and the need for people to come together.</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Challenges Faced (fast forward):</span>
          </p>
          <p>One of the core issues the company is facing is that its services are not meeting customer expectations. This, mainly due to changes in target customers, decreasing age and income groups, and customer’s poor perception of the company. Most Starbcuks customers reviewed the company as follows:</p>
          <ul style="font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px 0px 30px 40px; padding: 0px; color: rgb(22, 32, 64); font-family: Georgia, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 19.2px; background-color: rgb(254, 254, 254);">
            <li style="margin-left: 15px; box-sizing: border-box; list-style-type: disc;">‘Starbucks care primarily about making money’ –Up from 53% in 2000 to 61% in 2001</li>
            <li style="margin-left: 15px; box-sizing: border-box; list-style-type: disc;">‘Starbucks care primarily about building more stores’ – Up from 48% to 55%.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is also the lack of strategic marketing group – no chief marketing officer, as accepted by Day herself that ‘they were good at collecting market data and not disciplined in using this data.’</p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Core ISSUE:</span>
          </p>
          <p>The company is challenged on how to link customer satisfaction to an increase in sales and profitability. Should the company roll-out a $40 million plan to add 20 hours of labor a week? And how should the company differentiate itself from competitors?</p>

          <h1 style="text-align: left;">What factors accounted for the extraordinary success of Starbucks in the early 1990s?</h1>
          <p style="text-align: left;">In the early 1990s, Starbucks had a drive to be America’s ‘third place’ after home and work and to deliver a high quality product (coffee) that people could incorporate into their everyday life by a staff that knew their orders intimately in an atmosphere that encouraged people to linger and make connections.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks grew rapidly with almost no marketing budget through word of mouth of advertisement.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks managed to hire and retain a workforce (called ‘partners’) that had strong hard skills (making coffee) and soft skills (customer service) with low turnover rate (partners had satisfaction rates of 80-90% with turnover rates of 70% compared to industry average of 300%).</p>
          <p>The factors that contributed to the success of Starbucks in the 1990s:</p>
          <p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">High Quality Coffee</span>: &nbsp;sourced from the best suppliers throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Customer service, aka Customer Intimacy:</span> the ability for staff to personalize and remember each customer order. Starbucks partners were &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trained to have strong hard skills (operate cash registers and make handcrafted, often customized, beverages) and strong soft skills (greeting &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; customers, remembering orders, and going the extra step for customers)
          </p>
          <p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Atmosphere:</span> the ability to create that ‘third place’ where people in the community could meet and linger.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">Highly-motivated staff</span>: Starbucks offered its 60,000 partners, most of whom were hourly workers ages 17-23, health insurance and stock options. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Partner satisfaction rates were at 80-90% with turnover rates of 70%. The company encouraged internal promotion: 70% of managers were ex- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; baristas and 60% of district managers were ex-store managers.&nbsp;

          <h1 style="text-align: left;">What was so compelling about the Starbucks value proposition? What brand image did Starbucks develop during this period?</h1>
          <p>Starbucks Value Proposition was “Live Coffee” as in promote a national coffee culture and create experiences that people could weave into their everyday life. There are three main components of the value proposition high-quality coffee, customer service aka “customer intimacy,” and atmosphere all delivered by a rockstar team of highly trained and motivated partners.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks in the early 1990s wanted to be everywhere. Its company stores were located in high traffic, high volume, high visibility spaces in retail centers, office buildings, and university campuses. It also distributed its products through hotels and third party sellers. Starbucks wanted to reach people where the work, travel, shop, and dine.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks was seen as a place where affluent white collar workers, usually women, could get something convenitanly, quickly, in a nice environment on their way to work and then as a place where they could linger longer outside of work.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks brand image during the early 1990s was basically America’s coffee shop; a convenient place for affluent people to get their coffee and a great place to work.. The brand attempted to be everywhere physically, and with multiple channels of distribution, even managed to get its products into hotel rooms and airports.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks also had an image as a great place to work and move up. The benefits of working at starbucks plus the upward mobility earned Starbucks 47th place as best place to work in Fortune magazine, an accomplishment for a company with so many hourly workers.&nbsp;</p>

          <h1 style="text-align: left;">Why have Starbucks' customer satisfaction scores declined? Has the company's service declined, or is it simply measuring satisfaction wrong?</h1>
          <p>The customer service declined because they paid more attention to the product than the customer satisfaction. Starbucks expanded too quickly and lost track of customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Starbucks was measuring the company service the wrong way. It was flawed. The company’s service declined. Lacking in speed. Lacking in personalized service.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>The ideal Starbucks customer from a profitability standpoint is the repeat customer that visits +8 times a week and spends on average $4.42 per order. This represents 21% of Starbucks customer base and 61% of transactions with a high satisfaction rate.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>These highly satisfied customers also have a customer life of 8.3 years, which means they are regular consumers of starbucks at high volumes.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Continuing to cater to the long time customer that visits the store more than 5 times a month. To keep this customer highly satisfied, Starbucks can implement services like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expanding the stored value card to include freebies for repeat customers</li>
            <li>Build out a mobile application that lets customers build and store their favorite drinks and order them through the application.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Include a faster pickup line for regular customers to pick up their drinks.&nbsp;</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Yes. Investing $40 million to increase labor by 20 hours per store will increase employee productivity.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>Enhance employee motivation,maintain employee loyalty, reduce conflict, increase shareholder satisfaction, increase customer service.</li>
